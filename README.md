# Ultima 8 - Story Rework

### Motivation

Ultima 8 is an unfinished game. Issues like story plot holes, bad combat gameplay, jumping "puzzles", unfinished maps making it not that good.

I like to rework the story, that means I will play the whole game and research the internet to transcribe every dialog, every book and any information I find about the world of Pagan and try to remap it in this Repository.

The ultimate goal is to rework Ultima 8 in a game engine like Elder Scrolls Skyrim which has great mod support. I do this in my spare time and not every day. It will take a long time and I will plan to start the reworking in Elder Scrolls 6 maybe with a team of modders who'd like to help me on this journey. And yes only if Elder Scrolls 6 provides proper mod support, otherwise I have to rethink my plan and realize the game in something else.

This journey of recreating Ultima 8 will take a long time. I would say probably 2-3 years just for the story. Why? Yeah well, to be honest, this project is not the only one I am doing right now. I can only do this recreation in my spare time and when I don't know what to play. Don't get me wrong, but I thought about this project for two years and now I take the first step to begin it.

### Roadmap

* Play Ultima 8 as I used to \(so as authentic as possible\) and mark possible plot holes
* Augment existing maps on the internet \(there are maps of the game, there I have to mark NPC, Quests, Chests\)
* Replay again and enhance the plot holes
* Creative phase: Take the plot holes and try to make own interesting stories
* Waiting for Elder Scrolls 6 and the Modkit
* \(Optional\) Recruit Modding Team to speed up Development
